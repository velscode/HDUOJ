# Problem Description

Larry graduated this year and finally has a job. He’s making a lot of money, but somehow never seems to have enough. Larry has decided that he needs to grab hold of his financial portfolio and solve his financing problems. The first step is to figure out what’s been going on with his money. Larry has his bank account statements and wants to see how much money he has. Help Larry by writing a program to take his closing balance from each of the past twelve months and calculate his average account balance.

Larry今年毕业并且终于找到了一份工作。他挣了很多钱，但是看上去怎么都不够。Larry决定，他需要紧抓他的经济投资来解决他的财务问题。第一步是弄清楚他的钱怎么了。Larry有他的银行账户清单，想看看他有多少钱，帮助Larry写一个程序从过去十二个月的余额，计算他的平均余额。
