**Problem Description**

> background:
> A new semester comes , and the HDU also meets its 50th birthday. No matter what's your major, the only thing I want to tell you is:"Treasure the college life and seize the time." Most people thought that the college life should be colorful, less presure.But in actual, the college life is also busy and rough. If you want to master the knowledge learned from the book, a great deal of leisure time should be spend on individual study and practise, especially on the latter one. I think the every one of you should take the learning attitude just as you have in senior school.

背景：一个新的学期到来了，杭州电子科技大学迎来了五十周年校庆。无论你的专业是什么，我想告诉你的是：珍惜大学生活，抓紧时间。许多人任务大学生活是多彩，很少压力的，但是实际上，大学生活是忙碌充实的。如果你想从书本中掌握知识，一个好点子是你应该多学多练。我认为你们每一个人都应该保持上中学时的学习动力。

> "No pain, No Gain", HDU also has scholarship, who can win it? That's mainly rely on the GPA(grade-point average) of the student had got. Now, I gonna tell you the rule, and your task is to program to caculate the GPA.

没有压力就没有成功，HDU也有奖学金，谁可以获得他？当然是GPA最高的学生。现在，我将告诉你规则，你的任务是编写一个程序去计算GPA。

> If there are K(K > 0) courses, the i-th course has the credit Ci, your score Si, then the result GPA is
> GPA = (C1 * S1 + C2 * S2 +……+Ci * Si……) / (C1 + C2 + ……+ Ci……) (1 <= i <= K, Ci != 0)
> If there is a 0 <= Si < 60, The GPA is always not existed.

如果有K门课程，第i门课程的学分是Ci，你的成绩是Si，GPA的计算公式为(C1 * S1 + C2 * S2 +……+Ci * Si……) / (C1 + C2 + ……+ Ci……) 。如果有一门课程分数Si<60，那么GPA就不存在了。

**Input**

> The first number N indicate that there are N test cases(N <= 50). In each case, there is a number K (the total courses number), then K lines followed, each line would obey the format: Course-Name (Length <= 30) , Credits(<= 10), Score(<= 100).
> Notice: There is no blank in the Course Name. All the Inputs are legal

第一个数N表示有N个测试用例。每个测试用例中，有一个数K（课程总数），然后是K行，每行的格式是：课程名称、学分、分数。

注意：课程名称中没有空格，所有输入均是合法的

**Output**

> Output the GPA of each case as discribed above, if the GPA is not existed, ouput:"Sorry!", else just output the GPA value which is rounded to the 2 digits after the decimal point. There is a blank line between two test cases. 

输出GPA的结果，如果不存在输出"Sorry!"，保留两位小数，两个结果之间有一个空行隔开。
